Choosing an operating system is rather like picking out a car these days. One can go from mild to wild and 
everyting in between. My personal preference is Linux, with MacOS a very close second. If I were traveling
for work, I'd be on a Mac, no question about it.

For the application-toolset being used with `Spark`, I do not recommend Windows, and will not be showing
installaiton examples for it. If you must use a Windows Laptop or Workstation, I would highly recommend installing
`Virtualbox` and create a virtual machine for all things `Spark` related. The `Virtualbox` instructions
will cover installtion on Windows as well as `Vagrant`. Aside from that, all actions will take
place in a standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS desktop environment.

WHere paractical, examples will include additional mainstream Linux distributions such as: Alpine, CentOS,
Fedora, Debian, Mint, etc. The vvast majority of computational work takes place in on the command-line
or in Jupyter notbooks. There's no need for a heavyweight desktop unless you want / need it for other
applications. The choice is entirely up to you, however, the more resources you take up with a heavy
desktop environment, the less you have available for computing power.

## Hardware Considerations

There is no question about it, the more CPU cores and RAM you have, then faster results can be resturned.
SSD's, where ever possible, should be fully utilized.
